# Product Vision

## One-Line Definition

Openfolio is a service that automatically structures GitHub open-source contributions into a technical resume portfolio.

## Problem Statement

- Many developers contribute to open source but cannot present that work in a recruiter-friendly portfolio format.
- GitHub timelines are activity-centric, so they do not clearly communicate outcomes and technical strengths.
- Manually organizing contribution context (issues, PRs, reviews, impact) is costly.

## Target Users

- Developers with open-source contribution history who want to use it as a career asset.
- Developers who need a portfolio for hiring, job changes, or freelance opportunities.

## Core Value

- Collect: Gather distributed contribution data automatically.
- Interpret: Reframe contributions in terms of skills and impact.
- Present: Provide a shareable portfolio page.

## Non-Goals (Initial)

- Replacing generic ATS products
- Becoming a coding test platform
- Expanding into social network features
