# 2026-02-27 - Top Repository Album Layout for Better Viewport Usage

- Source: discussion
- Decision State: accepted
- Raw Context:
  - User requested making the top repository section more compact because the current list consumes too much screen height.
  - User suggested switching to album-style presentation to improve visibility of lower sections.
- Promotion Targets:
  - ADR: TBD
  - Spec/Doc: `docs/domains/architecture/system-design.md`
  - Backlog: `docs/domains/delivery/backlog.md`
- Notes:
  - Scope is rendering behavior only unless additional metadata is requested.
