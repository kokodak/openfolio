# 2026-02-27 - Preserve Raw Discussion Context for Future Ideation

- Source: discussion
- Decision State: accepted
- Raw Context:
  - User asked to keep a document that stores unrefined idea/inbox discussion data so context is not lost.
  - Purpose is to let the agent reference prior raw context for later idea proposals.
- Promotion Targets:
  - ADR: `docs/domains/operations/decision-log.md` (ADR-0008)
  - Spec/Doc: `AGENTS.md`, `docs/domains/operations/README.md`
  - Backlog: N/A (operations process update)
- Notes:
  - The inbox is additive and does not replace ADR/session/backlog documentation.
